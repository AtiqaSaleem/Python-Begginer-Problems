# 🐍 Python Beginner Problem Catalog

Welcome to the **Python Beginner Problem Catalog** — a carefully curated collection of beginner-level Python problems designed to help learners build strong programming fundamentals **from scratch**.

This repository is ideal for:
- Absolute beginners in Python
- Learners who haven’t studied Data Structures yet
- Anyone who wants to build logic through problem solving
- Students preparing for platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

Many platforms label problems as “Easy” — but they often assume prior knowledge of data structures and logic building.

This repository solves that problem by:
- Starting from **zero**
- Introducing concepts gradually
- Teaching **logic before complexity**
- Learning data structures naturally through problems

The goal is not just to solve problems — but to **think like a programmer**.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

The problems are organized in a step-by-step manner:

1. Python Basics & Syntax  
2. Variables and Data Types  
3. Conditional Statements  
4. Loops  
5. Strings  
6. Lists (First Data Structure)  
7. Tuples and Sets  
8. Dictionaries  
9. Functions  
10. File Handling  
11. Logic Building Mini Projects  

Each folder focuses on one concept and contains beginner-friendly problems related to that topic.
